Few month ago, people make a bid on vite which claimed to be the fastest build tools but now that might be yesterday stuff. ***Next.js*** is 70 times and 700 times faster than vite and webpack.
But there's much more about just fast.

## Step 1: Route handle

No more navigation 
## Step 2: Set up GitHub token

Click your Github profile -> then setting:

  alt="Dockerize Jupyter Notebook"
  sizes="100vw"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

Then click developer setting:

  alt="Dockerize Jupyter Notebook"
  sizes="100vw"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

Then, click personal access tokens and then generate new tokens: Chooes classic in here.

  sizes="100vw"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

Then, give this token a name. I set expiration to no expiration since I'm lazy to config it again soon.

Also make sure you check repo.This is the ***only*** thing that we checked. Then, click generate token!

  sizes="100vw"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

It should look like this so far, ***then copy and keep the token***!

  alt="Dockerize Jupyter Notebook"
  sizes="100vw"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

Make sure you check the same thing. Then, test upload option.

## Step 5: Try

Now, copy a image into typora, you should see that image is pushed to your GitHub repo. Congrats! Let's write more useless fun things together.
